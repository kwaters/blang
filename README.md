A self hosting B compiler.

Originally, I had planned on implementing a B compiler in python targeting a
VM also written in python.  This attempt is available in the attic/ branches.

Now, I'm bootstrapping a minimal B to C compiler in C, using a style similar
to the style I believe will be required in B.
